# Basketball 24 shot clock app

[Check it out!](https://wwww.24shotclock.com)

## Background

Sweet application that simulates a control panel of 24 basketball shot clock according to [FIBA](https://www.fiba.basketball/) rules, built in React.
I originally created it to practice in off-season time, but it is very fun also if just a basketball fan.

The best way to practice is to broadcast a game on your TV, and operate the shot clock according to occurrences in this game.
The application is updated from time to time according to the rules updates of FIBA.

## Operations

1. **Start** - starts and stops the clock.
2. **Reset 14s** - Reset the clock to 14 seconds (for example on offensive rebound or a team gaining ball control on the front half court).
3. **Reset 24s** - Reset the clock to 24 seconds when the team (for example when a team gaining ball control on the back half court, or 24 shot clock is over).
4. **Clear** - Clears the seconds view display (usually used between periods and during free throws shooting).
5. **Correction** - Fix the seconds display by increment / decrement seconds according to the referees decision after they have checked the monitor.
